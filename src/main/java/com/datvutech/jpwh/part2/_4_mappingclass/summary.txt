- Entities are the coarser-grained classes of your system. 
    Their instances have an "independent life cycle" and their "own identity", 
    and many other instances can reference them.

- Value types, on the other hand, are dependent on a particular entity class. 
A value type instance is bound to "its owning entity instance", and "only one entity"
instance can reference itâ€” it has no "individual identity".
